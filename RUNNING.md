## Notes on Getting Mathbox Running

- I've got this...

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install node
```

## Editing in Spacemacs

```
npm install -g eslint
```

That is sort of annoying.

When you get prompted for `lsp`, do `json-ls`.

### Spacemacs Layers

- `gpu`

### Safari
